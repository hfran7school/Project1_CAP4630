"""
This program will take States.csv
and create a list of State objects that
contain information about each state in
the file.
The user will be able to select from 5
different option: printing a report, 
sorting the States by either name or
case fatality rate, searching for a 
specific state's information, and
giving a Spearman's rho matrix based
on the data.
